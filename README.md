Getting the inputs of ints and strings and reversing them.
Started to validate the string and int and reverse them


Peer Reviewed by Isaiah Ferguson - Code is really well written the use of reverse for loops was really well done for both numbers and strings! the program loops as intended. the only thing i would like to say and im being a nit picky is the is the second option for strings also takes numbers since thats the case you wouln't really need the first for loop. regardly an awesome program!!
